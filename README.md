After learning about APIs and as a fan of machine learning algorithms, this is an attempt at creating a recommender system of poems/poets for a user. It was originally supposed to be a book recommender system, but the API to use changed some main components this idea was centered around, so until then, we are doing poems. 

Also note, this was decided on Toni Morrison's Nobel Prize winning anniversary and what also happens to be Toni Braxton's birthday - a day I affectionately call **Toni Day**. It is therefore appropriate to do this with legendary wordsmiths in mind! :blue_heart:

Onward :muscle:
