After learning about APIs and as a fan of machine learning algorithms, this is an attempt at creating a recommender system of books/authors for a user. It was originally supposed to be a book recommender system, but the API to use changed some main components this idea was centered around, so until then, we were going to do poems. However, we come back to books and find a way!

Also note, this was decided on October 7, 2020 -> Toni Morrison's Nobel Prize winning anniversary (1993) and what also happens to be Toni Braxton's birthday - a day I affectionately call **Toni Day**. It is therefore appropriate to do this with legendary wordsmiths in mind! :blue_heart:

Onward :muscle:
