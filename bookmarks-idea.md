# sort-my-bookmarks

This idea is not going to work right now because Twitter has bookmark data on the backend and their API does not support this, so we are pausing but will come back to it because we will think of something and make it happen!

An attempt to create a bookmarked tweets sorter using natural language processing and topic modelling techniques. We just started, so check back in a month or so. Might be fuller :smile:

This was inspired by [Cat Noone](https://twitter.com/imcatnoone)'s tweet begging for something like this to exist. Sure hope Twitter doesn't beat me to it, but still doing it for fun!
